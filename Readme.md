# OCD Patient Data Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of a dataset focused on patients diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). The analysis aims to uncover patterns and insights into demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics of OCD patients. It also includes visualizations to support data-driven conclusions.

## Dataset
The ocd_patient_dataset.csv file contains the following information:

1. **Demographics:**
Age, Gender, Ethnicity, and Marital Status of OCD patients.
Clinical Features:
2. **Y-BOCS Scores:** Obsession and compulsion severity levels.
Symptom Duration (in months).
Types of obsessions (e.g., harm-related) and compulsions (e.g., washing, checking).
3. **Co-morbidities:** Depression, Anxiety, and other associated conditions like MDD, PTSD, GAD, and Panic Disorder.
4. **Family History:**
Presence or absence of a family history of OCD.
5. **Treatment Details:**
Medication usage (e.g., Benzodiazepines, SSRIs, SNRIs).

## Key Features of the Notebook
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Loading and cleaning the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Distribution of age, gender, and ethnicity.
Analysis of obsession and compulsion types.
Examination of Y-BOCS scores and symptom durations.
3. **Visualization:**
Bar plots, box plots, and scatter plots for clear representation of findings.
Insights into recovery times and co-morbidity prevalence.
4. **Statistical Observations:**
Skewness in data distribution.
Analysis of recovery trends by age, gender, and family history.
